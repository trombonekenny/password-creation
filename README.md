# Password creation tips

## Punctuation

Punctuation that is available on the first screen of special characters in both Android and iOS keyboards.

> `@ $ & - ( ) " ' : ; ! ? , / .`

For example, `*` is a bad punctuation choice because it's buried two key presses in on iOS.

UIUC allowed: `$ & - ( ) ' : ; ! ? / .`
